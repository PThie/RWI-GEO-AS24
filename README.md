# RWI-GEO-CARMKT: Data on the Used Car Market in Europe

This repository shows the detailed preparation and generation of RWI-GEO-CARMKT dataset.

## Abstract Data Description (V1)

The FDZ Ruhr provides a dataset on car advertisements in Europe, drawing from information obtained from the online marketplace AutoScout24. The dataset includes a diverse range of vehicle listings, covering various manufacturers, models, fuel types, and other key characteristics. The dataset offers detailed regional information and a comprehensive set of attributes, making it suitable for analyzing car market trends, pricing, and consumer preferences. It is important to note that the data are available for scientific research purposes only.

The current version (V1) consists of listings for Germany between 01/2024 and 06/2024.

## Access

The data are available to researchers for non-commercial use. The data can be obtained in both .csv and .parquet file formats. It should be noted that data access to both versions requires a signed data use agreement. Both versions are restricted to non-commercial research; only researchers from scientific institutions are eligible to apply for data access.

Data access is provided by the Research Data Centre Ruhr at the RWI â€“ Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research (FDZ Ruhr). The data can be accessed at [https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/research-advice/further/research-data-center-ruhr-fdz/data-access](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/research-advice/further/research-data-center-ruhr-fdz/data-access). The application form includes a brief description and title of the project, potential cooperation, information on the applying department, expected duration of data usage as well as further participants in the project. 

Data users shall cite the datasets properly with the respective DOIs. The DOIs of the current version (V1) of the datesets are:
